# TVMaze API
This project contains a React JS user interface making use of the TVMaze rest API. This project was developed through my learning process of React JS and it's my first usable app with this JavaScript framework. You can search for shows stored in the TVMaze API.

## How it works?
You just have to look for a show which is available in TVMaze, then you select by clicking the show you want to know more about. All the information related to the shows come from the TVMaze API and also you can add some comments to each show. This comments are stored in a personal database and get loaded to the page using a custom API made with PHP. All of this is possible thanks to the asynchronous property of JS (AJAX and Fetch API) and by a custom hook in React (useFetch).

⚠️ Comments section is not working because a hosting problem about CORS policy
